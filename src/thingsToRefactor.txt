in case anyone ever finds this in the github version history: I am stupid and forget things and is also too stupid/lazy to use github porjects though I porbably should instead of spamming TODOs

In the transform_system the updatePerInstanceData
In the DrawableMesh it no longer keeps its own buffers
In the Renderer change the vertex start and index start values
(think about using multi-draw indirect rendering and make sure I don't stupidly archtecture it so its incompatable)
As always fix whatever test code in Engine.cpp
Purge the actual textures from cpu ram (the actual gltf binary is only 9mb for sponza so it memory usage shouldn't be too bad)

In DrawGroup make the big buffers
-make alloc and realloc for the big buffers
-(keep cpu side copies of vertex, index and instance data)
